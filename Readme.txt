How it works: 
The "Welcome" application is a blank app that will act as a "common" login page for all users. This app simply allows anyone with a back-office user account to login. 
Once logged in, the CSS files kick-in and turn the existing Ofbiz applications menu into Yellow buttons with Icons. That's it! Simple and quick :)     

Note:
This was made for the default Ofbiz visual theme "Tomahawk". Browsers tested: IE9, Firefox, Chrome. 

Instructions: 
1. Add the included "Welcome" folder to your "Ofbiz/hot-deploy" folder
2. Add the included CSS file, along with the font-awesome folder, to your Theme's CSS folder     
3. Restart Ofbiz and visit your root Ofbiz URL https://localhost:8443 (app is mounted to root) 
4. Login with any user account 
5. You should see all applications that account has access as Yellow buttons with Icons!
